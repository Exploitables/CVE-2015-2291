# CVE-2015-2291
 (1) IQVW32.sys before 1.3.1.0 and (2) IQVW64.sys before 1.3.1.0 in the Intel Ethernet diagnostics driver for Windows allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges via a crafted (a) 0x80862013, (b) 0x8086200B, (c) 0x8086200F, or (d) 0x80862007 IOCTL call.

I plan on creating a write-up for this soon, but I just want to get some sleep now.
